      question: "How often should I groom my pet?",
      answer: "The frequency depends on your pet's breed, coat type, and lifestyle. Generally, most dogs need grooming every 4-8 weeks, while cats may need it less frequently. We'll provide personalized recommendations during your consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I bring for my pet's appointment?",
      answer: "Just bring your pet! We provide all necessary grooming supplies, towels, and equipment. If your pet has any special medical needs or takes medications, please inform us beforehand."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a typical grooming session take?",
      answer: "A full grooming session typically takes 2-4 hours depending on your pet's size, coat condition, and the services requested. We'll give you an estimated time when you book your appointment."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle anxious or aggressive pets?",
      answer: "Yes, we have experience with pets of all temperaments. Our team uses gentle, stress-reducing techniques and can accommodate nervous pets. We may recommend shorter sessions or sedation (with vet approval) for extremely anxious animals."
    },
    {
      question: "What age can puppies start getting groomed?",
      answer: "Puppies can start with basic grooming (bath, nail trim, face cleaning) as early as 12-16 weeks after their second vaccination. Full grooming can begin once they're comfortable with basic handling."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer mobile grooming services?",
      answer: "Currently, we operate from our salon location to ensure we have access to all professional equipment and facilities. However, we're considering mobile services for the future - stay tuned!"
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
      answer: "We accept cash, all major credit cards, and bank transfers. Payment is due at the time of service unless other arrangements have been made in advance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stay with my pet during grooming?",
      answer: "While we understand your concern, we generally recommend that owners leave during grooming. Pets often behave better without their owners present, allowing our team to work more efficiently and safely."
